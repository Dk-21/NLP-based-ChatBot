 Cornell University is a private Ivy League land-grant research university based in Ithaca, New York.
The university was founded in 1865 by Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White.
Since its founding, Cornell has been a co-educational and nonsectarian institution.
As of fall 2023, the student body included over 16,000 undergraduate and 10,000 graduate students from all 50 U.S. states and 130 countries.
[4]
 The university is organized into seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions on its main Ithaca campus.
[9] Each college and academic division has near autonomy in defining its respective admission standards and academic curriculum.
In addition to its primary campus in Ithaca, the university administers three satellite campuses, including two in New York City and one in the Education City region of Qatar.
[9]
 Cornell is one of the few private land-grant universities in the United States.
[a] Among the university's seven undergraduate colleges, three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York system, including its College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, its Human Ecology College, and its Industrial Labor Relations School.
Among Cornell's graduate schools, only its Veterinary Medicine College is supported by New York state.
The main campus of Cornell University in Ithaca spans 745 acres (301 ha).
As of October 2023,[update] 62 Nobel laureates, four Turing Award winners, and one Fields Medalist have been affiliated with Cornell.
Cornell counts more than 250,000 living alumni, which include 34 Marshall Scholars,[10] 33 Rhodes Scholars, 29 Truman Scholars, 7 Gates Scholars, 63 Olympic Medalists, 10 current Fortune 500 CEOs, and 35 billionaires.
[11][12][13][14][15]
 Cornell University was founded on April 27, 1865, by Ezra Cornell, an entrepreneur and New York State Senator, and Andrew Dickson White, an educator and also a New York State Senator, after the New York State legislature authorized the university as the state's land grant institution.
[16] Ezra Cornell offered his farm in Ithaca, New York as a preliminary site for the university, and granted $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial endowment (equivalent to $11,884,000 in 2022) to the university.
White agreed to be Cornell University's first president.
During Cornell University's first three years, White oversaw the construction of the first two buildings and traveled to recruit promising students and faculty.
[17] The university was inaugurated on October 7, 1868, and 412 male students were enrolled the following day.
[18]
 Cornell developed as a technologically innovative institution, applying its academic research to its own campus and to outreach efforts.
In 1883, it was one of the first university campuses to use electricity from a water-powered dynamo to light the campus grounds.
[19] Since 1894, Cornell has included colleges that are state-funded and fulfill state statutory requirements;[20] it has also administered research and extension activities that have been jointly funded by New York state with U.S. federal government matching funds.
[21]
 Beginning with its first classes, Cornell University has had active and engaged alumni.
In 1872, the university became one of the first universities in the nation to include alumni-elected representatives on its board of trustees.
[b]
 Cornell University is home to Cornell University Press, founded in 1869, the country's oldest publishing enterprise.
Cornell was first home to the Cornell Era, a weekly campus publication founded in 1868.
In 1880, the Cornell Daily Sun, an independent student-run newspaper, was founded at the university.
The Cornell Daily Sun is one of the nation's longest continuously published student publications in the nation.
In the 19th century, Cornell had several literary societies that were founded to encourage writing, reading, and oration skills.
The U.S. Bureau of Education described three of them as a "purely literary society" following the "traditions of the old literary societies of Eastern universities, but they largely folded by the 20th century.
In 1967, Cornell experienced a fire in the Residential Club dormitory that killed eight students and one professor.
In the late 1960s, Cornell was among the Ivy League universities that experienced heightened student activism related to cultural issues, civil rights, and opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.
In 1969, after armed anti-Vietnam War protesters occupied Willard Straight Hall, leading to the resignation of Cornell president James Alfred Perkins and the restructuring of university governance.
[25]
 In 1995, the National Research Council ranked Cornell's Ph.D. programs as sixth-best in the nation.
It also ranked the following Cornell Ph.D. programs among the ten best in the nation in terms of academic quality: astrophysics (ninth-best), chemistry (sixth-best), civil engineering (sixth-best), comparative literature (sixth-best), computer science (fifth-best), ecology (fourth-best), electrical engineering (seventh-best), English (seventh-best), French (eighth-best), geosciences (tenth-best), German (third-best), linguistics (ninth-best), materials science (third-best), mechanical engineering (seventh-best), philosophy (ninth-best), physics (sixth-best), Spanish (eighth-best), and statistics/biostatistics (fourth-best).
The council ranked Cornell's College of Arts and Humanities faculty as fifth-best in the nation, its Mathematics and Physical Sciences as sixth-best, and its College of Engineering as fifth-best.
[26][27]
 Since 2000, Cornell has been expanding its international programs.
In 2004, the university opened Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar.
[28] It also has established partnerships with academic institutions in India, the People's Republic of China, and Singapore.
[29][30][31]
 In August 2002, the graduate student group At What Cost?
was formed at Cornell to oppose a graduate student unionization drive run by CASE/UAW, an affiliate of the United Auto Workers.
The unionization vote was held October 23–24, 2002, and the union was rejected.
At What Cost?
was considered instrumental in the unusually large 90% turnout for the vote and in the 2-to-1 defeat of the unionization proposal.
There had been no prior instance in American graduate student unionization history where a unionization proposal was defeated by a vote.
[32][33][34]
 On March 9, 2004, Cornell and Stanford University laid the cornerstone for a "Bridging the Rift Center" to be built and jointly operated for education on the Israel–Jordan border.
[35] In 2005, Jeffrey S. Lehman, a former president of Cornell, described the university and its high international profile as a "transnational university".
[36]
 In 2017, Cornell opened Cornell Tech, a graduate campus and research center on Roosevelt Island in New York City, which won a competition bid initiated by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg to spur technology entrepreneurship in New York City.
Cornell University's main campus is located in Ithaca, New York, on East Hill, offering views of the city and Cayuga Lake.
The campus has expanded to approximately 745 acres (301 ha) since its founding, comprising academic buildings, laboratories, administrative facilities, athletic centers, auditoriums, museums, and residential areas.
[37][38] In 2011, Travel+Leisure recognized the Ithaca Campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States, praising its unique blend of architectural styles, historic landmarks, and picturesque surroundings.
[39]
 The Ithaca campus is characterized by an irregular layout and a mix of architectural styles, which have developed over time due to the university's ever-changing master plans for the campus.
The more ornate buildings generally predate World War II.
Since then, more recent buildings on the campus are characterized by modernist architectural styles.
[40]
 Several Cornell University buildings have been named National Historic Landmarks,[41] Ten Cornell buildings have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Andrew Dickson White House, Bailey Hall, Caldwell Hall, the Computing and Communications Center, Morrill Hall, Rice Hall, Fernow Hall, Wing Hall, Llenroc, and 13 South Avenue (Deke House).
[42] Three other listed historic buildings, the original Roberts Hall, East Robert Hall, and Stone Hall, were demolished in the 1980s to make way for new campus buildings and development.
[43]
 The majority of academic and administrative facilities are located at Central Campus.
The architectural styles on Central Campus range from ornate Collegiate Gothic, Victorian, and Neoclassical buildings to more spare international, and modernist structures.
Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park, proposed a "grand terrace" overlooking Cayuga Lake in one of the earliest plans for the campus.
[44]
 North Campus features primarily residential buildings, with ten residence halls designed to accommodate first and second-year students, as well as transfer students in the Townhouse Community.,[45] The architectural styles of North Campus are more modern, reflecting the growth of the university and the need for additional housing during the mid-20th century.
The West Campus House System showcases a blend of architectural styles, with five main residence halls and several Gothic-style buildings collectively known as "the Gothics."
These Collegiate Gothic structures add a sense of historical charm to the campus, while the modern residence halls provide comfortable accommodations for students.
"[46]
 In the nearby Collegetown  neighborhood, the architectural styles are more diverse, reflecting the area's mixed-use nature.
The Schwartz Performing Arts Center and two upper-level residence halls[47][48] are surrounded by a variety of apartment buildings, eateries, and businesses, creating a vibrant and lively atmosphere for students and residents alike.
[49]
 The Ithaca campus is located in the Finger Lakes region and has views of the city, Cayuga Lake, and the surrounding valleys.
The campus is bordered by two gorges, Fall Creek Gorge and Cascadilla Gorge, which contribute to the university's natural landscape.
Although these gorges are popular swimming spots during warmer months, their use is discouraged by the university and city code due to potential safety hazards.
[50] Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,800-acre (1,100 ha) Cornell Botanic Gardens, featuring various plants, trees, and ponds.
The gardens' trails allow visitors to explore the natural surroundings.
[51]
 Cornell University has implemented various green initiatives to promote sustainability and reduce its environmental impact.
Key projects include a gas-fired combined heat and power facility,[52] an on-campus hydroelectric plant,[53] and a lake source cooling system.
[54] In 2007, Cornell established a Center for a Sustainable Future.
[55] The university has committed to achieving net carbon neutrality by 2035[56]  and, as of 2020, is powered by six solar farms providing a total of 28 megawatts of power.
[57] Additionally, Cornell is developing an enhanced geothermal system, Earth Source Heating, to meet campus heating needs.
[58] Cornell was the first university in the United States to commit to Kyoto Protocol emission reductions.
[59] Following a multiyear, cross-campus discussion about energy and sustainability, the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability was established in 2007, and received an $80 million gift from alumnus David R. Atkinson '60 and his wife Patricia, the largest gift ever received from an individual at Cornell University at that time, and a subsequent $30 million commitment in 2021 will name a new multidisciplinary building on campus.
[60]
 In 2023, a concert at Barton Hall by Dead and Company raised $3.1 million for organizations MusiCares and the Cornell 2030 Project, which has contributed to the establishment of the Climate Solutions Fund.
The fund aims to catalyze large-scale, impactful climate research across the university and will be administered by the Atkinson Center.
[61][62]
 Cornell's medical campus in New York City, also called Weill Cornell, is on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
It is home to two Cornell divisions: Weill Cornell Medical College and Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, and has been affiliated with the New York-Presbyterian Hospital since 1927.
[63] Although their faculty and academic divisions are separate, the Medical Center shares administrative and teaching hospital functions with the Columbia University Medical Center.
[64] These teaching hospitals include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan and the Westchester Division in White Plains, New York.
[65] Weill Cornell Medical College is also affiliated with the neighboring Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, Rockefeller University, and the Hospital for Special Surgery.
Many faculty members have joint appointments at these institutions.
Weill Cornell, Rockefeller, and Memorial Sloan–Kettering offer the Tri-Institutional MD–PhD Program to selected entering Cornell medical students.
[66] From 1942 to 1979, the campus also housed the Cornell School of Nursing.
[67]
 On December 19, 2011, Cornell and the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology won a competition for rights to claim free city land and $100 million in subsidies to build an engineering campus in New York City.
The competition was established by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to increase entrepreneurship and job growth in the city's technology sector.
The winning bid consisted of a 2.1 million square foot state-of-the-art tech campus to be built on Roosevelt Island, on the site of the former Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital.
Instruction began in the fall of 2012, in a temporary location at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan in space donated by Google.
[68] Thom Mayne, of the architecture firm Morphosis, has been selected to design the first building to be constructed on Roosevelt Island.
Begun in 2014, construction of the first phase of the campus was completed in September 2017.
[69]
 In addition to the tech campus and medical center, Cornell maintains local offices in New York City for some of its service programs.
The Cornell Urban Scholars Program encourages students to pursue public service careers, arranging assignments with organizations working with New York City's poorest children, families, and communities.
[71] The College of Human Ecology and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences enable students to reach out to local communities by gardening and building with the Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[72] Students with the School of Industrial and Labor Relations' Extension and Outreach Program make workplace expertise available to organizations, union members, policymakers, and working adults.
[73] The College of Engineering's Operations Research Manhattan, in the city's Financial District, brings together business optimization research and decision support services addressed to both financial applications and public health logistics planning.
[74] The College of Architecture, Art, and Planning has an 11,000 square foot, Gensler-designed facility at 26 Broadway in the Financial District, that opened in 2015.
[75] The General Electric Building at 570 Lexington Avenue serves as the New York location for over a dozen programs, including the NYC headquarters of the ILR School and the NYC branch of the Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[70]
 Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar is in Education City, near Doha.
Opened in September 2004, it was the first American medical school to be established outside of the United States.
The college is part of Cornell's program to increase its international influence.
The college is a joint initiative with the Qatar government, which seeks to improve the country's academic programs and medical care.
[28] Along with its full four-year MD program, which mirrors the curriculum taught at Weill Medical College in New York City, the college offers a two-year undergraduate pre-medical program with a separate admissions process.
This undergraduate program opened in September 2002 and was the first coeducational institute of higher education in Qatar.
[76]
 The college is partially funded by the Qatar government through the Qatar Foundation, which contributed $750 million for its construction.
[77] The medical center is housed in a large two-story structure designed by Arata Isozaki, an internationally known Japanese architect.
[78] In 2004, the Qatar Foundation announced the construction of a 350-bed Specialty Teaching Hospital, near the medical college in Education City.
The hospital was to be completed in a few years.
[28]
 Cornell University owns and operates a variety of off-campus research facilities and offers study abroad and scholarship programs.
[79]  These facilities and programs contribute to the university's research endeavors and provide students with unique learning opportunities.
Cornell's off-campus research facilities include Shoals Marine Laboratory, a seasonal marine field station on Appledore Island off the Maine–New Hampshire coast, is operated in conjunction with the University of New Hampshire and focuses on undergraduate education and research.
[80] Until 2011, Cornell operated the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, which was the site of the world's largest single-dish radio telescope.
[81]
 The university also maintains several facilities dedicated to conservation and ecology, such as the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York.
This station operates three substations, including the Cornell Lake Erie Research and Extension Laboratory in Portland,[82] the Hudson Valley Laboratory in Highland,[83] and the Long Island Horticultural Research Laboratory in Riverhead.

[86][87][88][89][90][13]
 Cornell offers various study abroad and scholarship programs that allow students to gain experience and earn credit towards their degrees.
The "Capital Semester" program offers students the opportunity to intern in the New York State Legislature in Albany.
The Cornell in Washington program enables students to spend a semester in Washington, D.C., participating in research or internships.
[91] Similarly, the Cornell in Rome program, allows students to study architecture, urban studies, and the arts in Rome, Italy.
[92]
 As New York State's land-grant university, Cornell operates a cooperative extension service with 56 offices spread across the state.
These offices provide programs in agriculture and food systems, children, youth and families, community and economic vitality, environment and natural resources, and nutrition and health.
[93] Additionally, the university operates New York's Animal Health Diagnostic Center, which serves as a valuable resource for animal disease control and husbandry.
[94]
 Cornell University is a non-profit organization with a decentralized structure where colleges and schools exercise wide autonomy in defining academic programs, admissions, advising, and conferring degrees.
The university comprises nine privately endowed colleges and four publicly supported statutory colleges, offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs.
Cornell operates eCornell for online professional development and certificate programs[95] and participates in New York's land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant programs.
[96][97]
 Cornell University is governed by a 64-member board of trustees, which includes both privately  and publicly appointed trustees.
The board includes trustees appointed by the Governor of New York, alumni-elected trustees, faculty-elected trustees, student-elected trustees,[98] and non-academic staff-elected trustees.
The Governor, Temporary President of the Senate, Speaker of the Assembly, and president of the university serve in an ex officio voting capacity.
The board is responsible for electing a President to serve as the chief executive and educational officer.
[99][100] Robert Harrison served as the chairman of the board from 2014 to 2022.
[101] The Board of Trustees holds four regular meetings each year, subject to the New York State Open Meetings Law.
[102] Kraig Kayser has served as the chairman of the board since 2022.

[105][106]
 Cornell's colleges and schools offer a wide range of undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs.
There are seven undergraduate colleges and seven schools offering graduate and professional programs.
All academic departments at Cornell are affiliated with at least one college.
A handful of inter-school academic departments offer courses in more than one college.
Students pursuing graduate degrees in these schools are enrolled in the Graduate School.
The School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions provides additional programs for college and high school students, professionals, and other adults.
[107]
 Cornell's statutory colleges include the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Human Ecology, School of Industrial and Labor Relations, and College of Veterinary Medicine.
These colleges received $131.9 million in SUNY appropriations in 2010–2011 to support their teaching, research, and service missions, making them accountable to the State University of New York (SUNY) trustees and other state agencies.
[108][109][110] New York residents enrolled in these colleges qualify for discounted tuition, however, their academic activities are considered by New York state to be private and non-state entities.
[111]:1
 Cornell's nine privately endowed, non-statutory colleges include the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Engineering, College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, and College of Hotel Administration.
These colleges operate independently of state funding and oversight, giving them greater autonomy in determining their academic programs, admissions, and advising.
They also do not offer discounted tuition for New York residents.
Of the 15,182 undergraduate students at Cornell, 4,602 (30.3%) are affiliated with the largest college by enrollment, Arts and Sciences, followed by 3,203 (21.1%) in Engineering and 3,101 (20.4%) in Agriculture and Life Sciences.
The smallest of the seven undergraduate colleges is Architecture, Art, and Planning, with 503 (3.3%) students.
[4] The only university-wide requirements for a baccalaureate degree are to pass a swimming test, take two physical education courses, and satisfy a writing requirement.
Cornell University has a robust fundraising program, ranking third among U.S. universities in 2018 (behind Harvard and Stanford), collecting $743 million in private support.
[112] Each college and program has its own staffed fundraising program, in addition to the central University development staff located in Ithaca and New York City.
In recent years, Cornell has been the recipient of several major donations that have enabled the university to expand its reach, create new programs, and drive advancements in education and research.
Charles Feeney, founder of DFS Group, is Cornell's largest donor, having given one billion dollars to the university to fund numerous initiatives, including Cornell Tech, a cutting-edge technology-focused campus in New York City.
[113] In 2017, the university also received a donation of $150 million from H. Fisk Johnson of S. C. Johnson & Son to create of the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business, the second largest ever gift to a business school.
[114] Furthermore, the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future was established in 2010 following an $80 million donation from David Atkinson and his wife, Patricia.
[115] In 2015, Joan and Irwin M. Jacobs, founder of Qualcomm, donated $133 million to fund the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech.
[116] The Weill Cornell Medical College was founded thanks to a $100 million donation in 1998 from Citibank head Sanford I. Weill and his wife, Joan, with the Weills providing over $600 million in total lifetime donations to the university.
[117]
 Cornell is a large, primarily residential research university with a majority of enrollments in undergraduate programs.
[118] The university has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education or its predecessor since 1921.
[119] Cornell operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall term beginning in late August and ending in early December, a three-week winter session in January, and the spring term beginning in late January and ending in early May.
[120]
 Cornell, along with Oregon State University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Georgia, and University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, are the only institutions to be land-grant universities that are also members of the other three "grant" programs: sea grant, space grant, and sun grant.
Cornell is the only such private university.
Admission to Cornell University is highly competitive.
In spring of 2022 (Class of 2026), Cornell's undergraduate programs received 71,164 applications and admitted only 5,168 for a 7.2% acceptance rate.
[122] For Fall 2019 enrolling freshmen, the middle 50% range of SAT scores were 680–760 for evidence-based reading and writing and 720–800 for mathematics.
[123] The middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 32–35.
[123]
 The university continues to attract a diverse and inclusive student body.
The proportion of admitted students who self-identify as underrepresented minorities increased to 34.2% from 33.7% in 2021, and 59.3% self-identify as students of color.
That number has increased steadily over the past five years, enrollment officials said, from 52.5% in 2017 and 57.2% in 2020.
Of those admitted, 1,163 will be first-generation college students, another increase over 2020's 844.
[124] The university is need-blind for domestic applicants.
[125]
 Cornell University, under Section 9 of its original charter, ensures equal access to education by admitting students without distinction based on rank, class, occupation, or locality.
[126] The charter also mandates free instruction for one student from each Assembly district in the state.
[126]
 From the 1950s to the 1980s, Cornell collaborated with other Ivy League institutions to establish a uniform financial aid system.
[127]  Although a 1989 consent decree ended this collaboration due to an antitrust investigation, all Ivy League schools still offer need-based financial aid without athletic scholarships.
[128] In December 2010, Cornell pledged to match any grant component of financial aid offers from other Ivy League schools, MIT, or Stanford for accepted applicants considering these institutions.
[129]
 In 2008, Cornell introduced a financial aid initiative, gradually replacing need-based loans with scholarships for undergraduate students from lower-income families.
[130] Despite a 27% drop in the university's endowment in 2008, the then-president allocated additional funds to continue the initiative, seeking to raise $125 million in donations for its support.
[131] By 2010, Cornell successfully met the full financial aid needs of 40% of full-time freshmen with financial need, and the average undergraduate student debt upon graduation was $21,549.
[132]

Faculty-led publications include the Johnson School's Administrative Science Quarterly,[176] the ILR School's Industrial and Labor Relations Review, the Arts and Sciences Philosophy Department's The Philosophical Review, the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning's Journal of Architecture, and the Law School's Journal of Empirical Legal Studies.
[177]  Student-led scholarly publications include the Law Review, the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs' Cornell Policy Review, the International Law Journal, the Journal of Law and Public Policy, the International Affairs Review, and the HR Review.
Physical Review, recognized internationally as among the best and well known journals of physics, was founded at Cornell in 1893 before being later managed by the American Physical Society.
Cornell University is a prominent research institution, classified among "R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity".
[178] The National Science Foundation ranked Cornell 14th among American universities for research and development expenditures in 2021 with $1.18 billion.
[179][180] The Department of Health and Human Services and the National Science Foundation are the primary federal investors, accounting for 49.6% and 24.4% of all federal investments, respectively.
[181]  Cornell is ranked fourth in the world for producing graduates who pursue PhDs in engineering or natural sciences at American institutions and fifth for graduates pursuing PhDs in any field.
[182]
 Cornell has a rich history of scientific, technological, and engineering research accomplishments.
The university has made significant contributions to the fields of nuclear physics, high-energy physics, space exploration, automotive safety, and computing technology, among others.
Cornell consistently ranks among the top U.S. universities for patent acquisition and start-up company formation.
[183]  In the 2004–05 academic year, the university filed 203 U.S. patent applications, completed 77 commercial license agreements, and distributed royalties of more than $4.1 million to Cornell units and inventors.
[13] In 2009 Cornell spent $671 million on science and engineering research and development, the 16th highest in the United States.
[184]
 Cornell has been involved in uncrewed missions to Mars since 1962[185]  and played a vital role in the Mars Exploration Rover Mission in the 21st century.
[186]  The university's researchers discovered the rings around the planet Uranus[187] and operated the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico until 2011.
This observatory housed the world's largest single-dish radio telescope at the time.
[188]
 The Automotive Crash Injury Research Project, begun in 1952, was a pioneering effort in crash testing and significantly improved vehicle safety standards.
[189] It was the first to use corpses instead of dummies for testing, leading to crucial findings about the effectiveness of seat belts, energy-absorbing steering wheels, padded dashboards, and improved door locks.
[189]
 Cornell has long been at the forefront of advancements in computing technology.
In the 1980s, the university deployed the first IBM 3090-400VF and coupled two IBM 3090-600E systems to investigate coarse-grained parallel computing.
As part of the National Science Foundation's initiative to establish new supercomputer centers, the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing was founded.
Cornell has continued to innovate in this area, most recently deploying Red Cloud, a cloud computing service designed specifically for research.
The Red Cloud service is now part of the NSF's Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) supercomputing program.
[190]
 In the realm of high-energy physics, Cornell scientists have been researching fundamental particles for over 75 years.
The university has played an integral role in the foundations of nuclear physics, with faculty members such as Hans Bethe and others participating in the Manhattan Project.
In the 1930s, Cornell built the second cyclotron in the United States and, in the 1950s, became the first to study synchrotron radiation.
The Cornell Electron Storage Ring, located beneath Alumni Field, was once the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider.
[191][192] Cornell's accelerator and high-energy physics groups are involved in the design of the proposed International Linear Collider, which will complement the Large Hadron Collider and shed light on questions related to dark matter and the existence of extra dimensions.
[193]
 For the 2016–2017 academic year, Cornell had over 1,000 registered student organizations.
These clubs and organizations run the gamut from kayaking to full-armor jousting, from varsity and club sports and a cappella groups to improvisational theatre, from political clubs and publications to chess and video game clubs.
[195] The Cornell International Affairs Society sends over 100 Cornellians to collegiate Model United Nations conferences across North America and hosts the Cornell Model United Nations Conference each spring for over 500 high school students.
The Cornell University Mock Trial Association regularly sends teams to the national championship and is ranked 5th in the nation.
[196] Additionally, the Cornell International Affairs Society's traveling Model United Nations team is ranked number 16 in the nation.
[197] Cornell United Religious Work is a collaboration among many diverse religious traditions, helping to provide spiritual resources throughout a student's time at college.
The Cornell Catholic Community is the largest Catholic student organization on campus.
Student organizations also include a myriad of groups including a symphony orchestra,[198] concert bands,[199] formal and informal choral groups,[200] including the Sherwoods, the Chordials[201] and other musical groups that play everything from classical, jazz, to ethnic styles in addition to the Big Red Marching Band, which performs regularly at football games and other campus events.
[202]
 Organized in 1868, the oldest Cornell student organization is the Cornell University Glee Club.
[203] Cornell also has an active outdoor community, including Cornell Outdoor Education and Outdoor Odyssey, a student-run group that runs pre-orientation trips for first-year and transfer students.
A Cornell student organization, The Cornell Astronomical Society, runs public observing nights every Friday evening at the Fuertes Observatory.
The university is home to the Telluride House, an intellectual residential society.
The university is also home to three secret honor societies, Sphinx Head,[204] Der Hexenkreis, and Quill and Dagger[205][206] that have maintained a campus presence for over 120 years.
Cornell's clubs are primarily subsidized financially by the Student Assembly and the Graduate & Professional Student Assembly, two student-run organizations with a collective budget of $3.0 million per year.
[207][208] The assemblies also finance other student life programs including a concert commission and an on-campus theater.
Cornell hosts a large[209][210][211][212][213] fraternity and sorority system, with 70 chapters involving 33% of male and 24% of female undergraduates.
[214][215][216] Cornell's Greek Life has an extensive history on the campus with the first fraternity, Zeta Psi, being chartered by the end of the university's first year.
[217] Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek organization established for African Americans, was founded at Cornell in 1906.
[218][219] Alpha Zeta fraternity, the first Greek-lettered organization established for Latin Americans in the United States, was also founded at Cornell on January 1, 1890.
Alpha Zeta served the wealthy international Latin American students that came to the United States to study.
This organization led a movement of fraternities that catered to international Latin American students that was active from 1890 to 1975.
[220] On 19 February 1982, La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda fraternity was established;[221] it would eventually become the only Latino based fraternity in the nation with chapters at every Ivy League institution.
[222] Latinas Promoviendo Comunidad/Lambda Pi Chi sorority was established on 16 April 1988, making the organization the first Latina-Based, and not Latina-exclusive, sorority founded at an ivy-league institution.
[223]
 Cornell's connection to national Greek life is strong and longstanding.
Many chapters are among the oldest of their respective national organizations, as evidenced by the proliferation of Alpha-series chapters.
The chapter house of Alpha Delta Phi constructed in 1877 is believed to be the first house built in America solely for fraternity use, and the chapter's current home was designed by John Russell Pope.
[224] Philanthropy opportunities are used to encourage community relations, for example, during the 2004–05 academic year, the Greek system contributed 21,668 community service and advocacy hours and raised $176,547 in charitable contributions from its philanthropic efforts.
[215] Generally, discipline is managed internally by the inter-Greek governing boards.
As with all student, faculty or staff misconduct, more serious cases are reviewed by the Judicial Administrator, who administers Cornell's justice system.
[215]
 The Cornell student body produces several works by way of print and radio.
Student-run newspapers include The Cornell Daily Sun, an independent daily; The Cornell Review, a conservative newspaper published fortnightly; and The Cornell Progressive, a liberal newspaper published monthly.
Other press outlets include The Cornell Lunatic, a campus humor magazine; the Cornell Chronicle, the university's newspaper of record; and Kitsch Magazine, a feature magazine published in cooperation with Ithaca College.
The Cornellian is an independent student organization that organizes, arranges, produces, edits, and publishes the yearbook of the same name; it is composed of artistic photos of the campus, student life, and athletics, and the standard senior portraits.
It carries the Silver Crown Award for Journalism and a Benjamin Franklin Award for Print Design – the only Ivy League Yearbook with such a distinction.
[225] Cornellians are represented over the radio waves on WVBR-FM, an independent commercial FM radio station owned and operated by Cornell students.
Other student groups also operate internet streaming audio sites.
[226]
 University housing is broadly divided into three sections: North Campus, West Campus, and Collegetown.
Cornell began experiments with co-ed dormitories in 1971 and continued the tradition of residential advisors (RAs) within the campus system.
In 1991, new students could be found throughout West Campus, including at the historic Baker and Boldt Hall complexes; since a 1997 residential initiative, West Campus houses transfer and returning students, whereas North Campus is mostly populated by freshmen and sophomores as well as sorority and fraternity houses.
[227] Prior to 2022, North Campus residents were overwhelmingly freshman, but the completion of the North Campus Residential Expansion now provides housing for 800 sophomores in Toni Morrison Hall and Ganędagǫ Hall.
[228]
 Options for living on North Campus for upperclassmen include program houses and co-op houses.
Program houses include Risley Residential College, Just About Music, the Ecology House, Holland International Living Center, the Multicultural Living Learning Unit, the Latino Living Center, Akwe:kon, and Ujamaa.
The co-op houses on North are The Prospect of Whitby, Triphammer Cooperative, Wait Avenue Cooperative, Wari Cooperative, and Wait Terrace.
[229] On West Campus, there are three university-affiliated cooperatives, 660 Stewart Cooperative, Von Cramm Hall, and Watermargin, and one independent cooperative, Cayuga Lodge.
In an attempt to create a sense of community and an atmosphere of education outside the classroom and continue Andrew Dickson White's vision, a $250 million reconstruction of West Campus created residential colleges there for undergraduates.
[230] The idea of building a house system can be attributed in part to the success of Risley Residential College, the oldest continually operating residential college at Cornell.
[231] In 2018, Cornell announced its North Campus Residential Expansion project, which was completed in Fall 2022.
The university added 2,000 beds on North Campus through five new dorms and a dining hall.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg Hall, Hu Shih Hall, and Barbara McClintock Hall are located on the east end of North Campus and are exclusively for freshmen.
Sophomores have the option to live in Toni Morrison Hall or Ganędagǫ Hall, which are located on the west end of North Campus.
[232]
 Cornell has several housing areas for graduate and professional students.
Of these, Schuyler House, which was formerly a part of Sage Infirmary,[233] has a dorm layout.
Maplewood Apartments, Hasbrouck Apartments, and Thurston Court Apartments are apartment-style, some even allowing for family living.
Off campus, many single-family houses in the East Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have been converted to apartments.
Private developers have also built several multi-story apartment complexes in the Collegetown neighborhood.
Nine percent of undergraduate students reside in fraternity and sorority houses, although first semester freshmen are not permitted to join them.
[234] Cornell's Greek system has 67 chapters and over 54 Greek residences that house approximately 1,500 students.
About 42% of Greek members live in their houses.
[235] Housing cooperatives or other independent living units exist, including Telluride House, the Center for Jewish Living, Phillips House (located on North Campus, 1975 all women; 2016, all men), and Center for World Community (international community, off campus, formed by Annabel Taylor Hall, 1972, mixed gender).
[236] The cooperative houses on North include The Prospect of Whitby, Triphammer Cooperative, Wait Avenue Cooperative, Wari Cooperative, and Wait Terrace.
[229] On West Campus, there are three university-affiliated cooperatives, 660 Stewart Cooperative, Von Cramm Cooperative Hall, and "Watermargin"., and one independent cooperative, "Cayuga Lodge".
Besides this, there exists also cooperative housing not owned by Cornell, like Gamma Alpha or Stewart Little.
As of 2023[update], Cornell's dining system was ranked fourth in the nation by The Princeton Review.
[237] The university has 29 on-campus dining locations, including 10 "All You Care to Eat" cafeterias.
[238] North Campus is home to 3 of these dining halls: Morrison Dining (located by Morrison Hall), North Star Dining Room (located in the Appel Commons), and Risley Dining (located in Risley Hall).
[238] West Campus houses 6 dining halls, 5 of which accompany the West Campus residential houses: Cook House Dining Room, Becker House Dining Room, Rose House Dining Room, Jansen's Dining Room at Hans Bethe House, and Keeton House Dining Room.
[238] Also located on West Campus is 104West!, a kosher/multicultural dining room.
[238] Central Campus accommodates just a single dining hall: Okenshields, located in Willard Straight Hall.
[238]
 Cornell has 35[239] varsity intercollegiate teams that have the nickname of the Big Red.
An NCAA division I institution, Cornell is a member of the Ivy League and ECAC Hockey and competes in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), the largest athletic conference in North America.
[240] (ECAC Hockey is no longer affiliated with the ECAC.)
Cornell's varsity athletic teams consistently challenge for NCAA Division I titles in a number of sports, including men's wrestling, men's lacrosse, men's ice hockey, and rowing (the women's crew program is subject to the NCAA, while the men's rowing program is governed by its own administrative body, the Intercollegiate Rowing Association).
Under the Ivy League athletic agreement, the university does not offer athletic scholarships for athletic recruiting.
[241]
 Cornell's football team had at least a share of the national championship four times before 1940[242][243] and has won the Ivy League championship three times, last in 1990.
[244]
 In 2010, the Cornell men's basketball team appeared for the first time in the NCAA tournament's East Regional semifinals, known as the "Sweet 16".
It was the first Ivy League team to make the semifinals since 1979.
[245]
 Cornell runs one of the largest collegiate outdoor education programs in the country, serving over 20,000 people every year.
The program runs over 130 different courses including but not limited to: Backpacking and Camping, Mountain Biking, Bike Touring, Caving, Hiking, Rock and Ice Climbing, Wilderness First Aid, and tree climbing.
[246] COE also oversees one of the largest student-run pre-freshman summer programs, known as Outdoor Odyssey.
[247] Most classes are often entirely taught by paid student instructors and courses count toward Cornell's physical education graduation requirement.
[248]
 One notable facility at Cornell Outdoor Education is the Lindseth Climbing Wall.
The wall was renovated in 2016, and now includes 8,000 square feet of climbing surface up from 4,800 square feet previously.
[249] The new wall now offers a more modern environment with bouldering, top-rope, and lead climbing facilities appropriate for various skill levels.
[250]
 Cornelliana is a term for Cornell's traditions, legends, and lore.
Cornellian traditions include Slope Day, a celebration held on the last day of classes of the spring semester, and Dragon Day, which includes the parading of a dragon built by architecture students.
Dragon Day is one of the school's oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since 1901, historically on or near St. Patrick's Day.
The dragon is built by the first-year architecture students in the week preceding the start of Spring Break.
Taunting messages are left for the engineering students during the week leading into Dragon Day, with pranks, a "nerd walk," and even "green streak" (in which the students paint themselves green) often targeting engineers and their classes.
On Dragon Day, the dragon is paraded around central campus by the first-year students, starting behind Rand Hall and moving through Cornell until eventually returning towards the Arts Quad.
During the parade, the upper-year architecture students walk behind the dragon in various costumes, typically constructed by themselves for the event.
Throughout much of its history, the dragon was then set afire upon its arrival to the arts quad, but that has since been discontinued due to environmental regulations.
[251][252][253]
 According to legend, if a virgin crosses the Arts Quad at midnight, the statues of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White will walk off their pedestals, meet in the center of the Quad, and shake hands, congratulating themselves on the chastity of students.
There is also another myth that if a couple crosses the suspension bridge on North Campus, and the young woman does not accept a kiss from her partner, the bridge will fall.
If the kiss is accepted, the couple is assured a long future together.
[254]
 The university is also host to various student pranks.
For example, on at least two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7 m) tall McGraw clock tower—once a 60-pound (27 kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball.
Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.
[255] The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day.
[256] The clock tower also plays music.
The school colors are carnelian (a shade of red) and white, a play on "Cornellian" and Andrew Dickson White.
A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot "Touchdown" in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games.
[8] The university's alma mater is "Far Above Cayuga's Waters", and its fight song is "Give My Regards to Davy".
People associated with the university are called "Cornellians".
Cornell offers a variety of professional and peer counseling services to students.
[257] Formerly called Gannett Health Services until its name change in 2016, Cornell Health offers on-campus outpatient health services with emergency services and residential treatment provided by Cayuga Medical Center.
[258]  For most of its history, Cornell provided residential medical care for sick students, including at the historic Sage Infirmary.
[259] Cornell offers specialized reproductive health and family planning services.
[260] The university also has a student-run Emergency Medical Service (EMS) agency.
The squad provides emergency response to medical emergencies on the campus at Cornell and surrounding university-owned properties.
Cornell EMS also provides stand-by service for university events and provides CPR, First Aid and other training seminars to the Cornell community.
[261]
 The university received attention for a series of six student suicides by jumping into a gorge that occurred during the 2009–10 school year, and after the incidents added temporary fences to the bridges which span area gorges.
[262] In May 2013, Cornell indicated that it planned to set up nets, which will extend out 15 feet, on five of the university's bridges.
[263] Installation of the nets began in May 2013 and were completed over the summer of that year.
[262] There were cases of gorge-jumping in the 1970s and 1990s.
[264] Before this abnormal cluster of suicides, the suicide rate at Cornell had been similar to or below the suicide rates of other American universities, including a period between 2005 and 2008 in which no suicides occurred.
[265][266]
 Cornell University Police protect the campus and are classified as peace officers and have the same authority as the Ithaca city police.
They are similar to the campus police at Ithaca College, Syracuse University, and University of Rochester because those campus police are classified as armed peace officers.
The Cornell University Police are on campus and on-call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
Their duties include: patrolling the university around the clock, responding to emergencies and non-emergency calls for service, crime prevention services, active investigation of crimes on campus, enforcement of state criminal and motor vehicle laws, and campus regulations.
